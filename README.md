# Raspberry Pi notes

I have a Raspberry Pi 3 and 4 (and I might buy a 5 at some point) and I tend to forget how I did things, so I'm keeping my notes here.

## Setup

1. Install Raspberry Pi OS using [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
2. Configure settings with a username and name your device, and enable SSH
3. SSH using `ssh username@name.local`
